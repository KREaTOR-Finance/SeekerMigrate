You are working in the repo C:/Users/Buidl/Desktop/SeekerMigrate/SeekerMigrate. Create a new web dev app inside the monorepo at apps/web that mimics the mobile app workflow using React Router (keep it simple).

Goals:
- Use Vite + React + TypeScript.
- Routing should mimic mobile stack flow: /disclosure -> /wallet (mock connect) -> /identity -> /devkit -> /profile.
- Implement an Android-like phone frame/shell (centered fixed width) with an app header and a right-side connect/status pill that routes to /wallet.
- Implement a small session store (React context) with mock wallet: connect/disconnect, publicKey, and simple flags. Must be resilient if localStorage is unavailable (fallback in-memory).
- Port the existing screen content & style tokens from public/index.html into these React screens. Reuse existing assets in public/ (wordmark, hero, etc.). It's OK to reuse/trim CSS.
- Profile screen: include connect/disconnect, common profile dataset presets, and icon picker using the sprite at public/avatars/ivan-sprite.jpg (label as icons, not Ivan). Persist selection in session store.
- Identity screen: vanity suffix length 4-6; allow Base58 characters; show validation.
- DevKit screen: stub flow with local-run info and a placeholder "Run migration locally" action.

Repo integration:
- Create apps/web/package.json etc.
- Add root scripts: dev:web (run apps/web dev server), build:web, preview:web.
- Ensure no changes break apps/mobile.

After implementing, run: npm install in apps/web and ensure npm run dev:web starts.

When completely finished, run: clawdbot gateway wake --text "Done: created apps/web React dev app with mobile-mimic routing + mock wallet + profile presets/icon picker" --mode now
